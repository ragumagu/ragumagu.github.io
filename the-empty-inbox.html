                Recently, I listened to Randy Paush's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0" target="_blank">talk</a> on time management, and he speaks about his empty inbox for a few seconds<label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-talk-link">&#8853;</label><input
                    type="checkbox" id="mn-talk-link" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">I suggest listening to the entire talk, as it is an invaluable resource. However, if you just want to hear the quote, click <a href="https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0?t=1763" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>:

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        In the middle [ of his screen space ] is my mail program. <b>Note the empty inbox</b> [ gestures towards the projector screen, like a disney princess ] [ audience laughs ]. And I try very hard... I sleep better if I go to sleep
                        with the inbox empty. When my inbox does creep up, I get really testy. So, my wife will actually say to me, I think you need to clear the inbox.

            <p>
                A few years ago when I had first listened to this talk, I had cleared my inbox. Now, it was time to do it again. I checked my inbox: I had 1700+ emails left unread. It was a lot of clutter, and the pile was growing everyday. Even if I could search and
                find a particular one when needed, it was a burden to deal with so much mail. It reduced the effectiveness - I wasn't getting the most out of my mail program.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of those emails were just receipts and advertisements, many of them atleast six months old. I would never go back and actually read them. I archived the receipts, and deleted the advertisements.
            </p>

            <p>
                This exercise got me thinking - it could be that I wasn't using the inbox the right way. Letting it pile into a large heap of unread mail, and then bulk deleting is not good: I might end up deleting important mail. Surely, there has to be a better way
                to keep my inbox clean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Curiously, I looked up the etymology of inbox. I learned that an inbox / in-tray / in-basket was a thing back in the twentieth century. You were supposed to put the incoming office mail into the in-box (<em>in</em>-coming mail-
                <em>box</em>) on your desk and deal with it till you were done with all the associated requests.

            </p>
            <p>
                You would go on to write letters and put them in the out-box. In the process, you would make documents, receipts and other records by hand. If you had a bunch of related papers, you would put them in a file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, in order to make a file, people bind a few sheets of paper with strings and glue. A file folder (commonly called a folder) is then used to hold multiple files. A shelf / cabinet is used to store multiple folders.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, with computers being ubiquitous, not all files are bound together with strings. An electronic file is a stream of bits of data, and it might not have pages within. An electronic folder can hold files, and it can hold other folders too. We simply
                say folder to mean file folder, and we don't need shelves or cabinets in our computers: folders do the job. This is one of those things where the electronic / virtual format has become vastly more popular than the physical format, and
                so, the common usage and the meaning of the words themselves has changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aha! There it is: you are supposed to organize your mail into folders, and put labels on them.
                Sure, gmail (the mail program I use) makes it easier by providing options to move your mails to one of [archive , sent , drafts, etc.], and to label them [important, starred, unread, etc.]. But, it
                is just a convenience, and there is a lot more you can do, by actively creating more folders and labels for yourself. Finally, the verb <q>move to <i>&lt; insert-folder-name-here &gt; </i></q> makes sense: you are moving your mail from one folder to another, just like you would do with a physical file.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also found that gmail provides keyboard shortcuts. Press e to archive an email, press # to delete an email and so on. This is going to be quite handy, I think.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, to archive, means to put it away where it can be found later with some searching. And to delete an email, is to put it in trash where it will be lost after 30 days if not recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note the physical analogue: you archive books and documents by taking them off of your desk and storing them in another place, so you can search for them at a later time. And to trash is to put it aside, in this case, into a bin, where it stays till the
                bin is emptied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I understand why folders and labels are useful in gmail.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might be using tools without knowing how they were built. You might not know the design decisions: reasons for why the tool is built that way. That's fine: a good interface should take care of all the pesky little details that are inherent to the
                problem you are solving.

                However, you might be struggling to do a task simply because of bad technique. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                A bit of reading can help you figure out how to use your tools in a better way.
                A usage guide might explain how, but it might not explain why.
                In such cases, looking into the etymology and history will give you a hint.
