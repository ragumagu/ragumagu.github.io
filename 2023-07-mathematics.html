                    Mathematics can be notoriously dense. Check out this
                    deceptive piece of math, trying to prove what looks like two
                    different numbers to be the same:
                </p>

                <pre>
                <code>
                          x = 0.999...
                        10x = 9.999...
                    10x - x = 9.999... - 0.999...
                         9x = 9
                          x = 1
                 &therefore; 0.999... = 1
                </code>

                    The post asked if the above logic was correct. The response
                    was:
                </p>

                <div class="epigraph">
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            It is correct that <code>0.999...</code> equals 1
                            exactly. However, this proof is incomplete, because
                            it is showing, that if <code>0.999...</code> equals
                            anything, then it must equal 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Symbols don't have meaning by themselves, until we
                            decide on one. Addition makes sense for adding
                            finitely many things, but if you want to extend this
                            idea to infinities (in this case, the infinity hides
                            behind the 3 dots in <code>0.999...</code>), then
                            you have to precisely define what you mean (when you
                            write <code>0.999...</code>).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People have agreed upon a standard definition for
                            what it means to add together infinitely many things
                            - they do so using the concept of a limit (usually
                            taught in calculus). However, not all infinite sums
                            exist (using the standard definition). We use the
                            term <q>converge</q> instead of <q>exist</q>, but it
                            is the same thing. For example, the sum
                            <code>1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) ... </code>
                            does not converge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To prove that
                            <code>0.999...</code> equals 1, you have to first
                            show that it converges at all, using the precise
                            definition of an infinite sum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, once you know that it converges to something,
                            you can call that something X and then all the steps
                            in the <q>proof</q> work. More specifically, they
                            work due to theorems we call limit laws. The limit
                            laws let you manipulate infinite sums in the way
                            you'd manipulate numbers, but only if all these
                            limits exist.

                <p>There are many things to learn from this post.</p>
                <p>
                    Mathematics is notoriously dense. Just writing
                    <code>0.999...</code> brings in so many concepts and
                    complexities that it can become overwhelming quite fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have to precisely define every symbol, and sometimes,
                    you will have to define numbers too. Since there is a lot of
                    detail, mistakes can happen quite easily. You can easily
                    fall into the trap of thinking that you know something
                    clearly, without actually knowing it in enough detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rewriting <code>0.999...</code> as
                    $$\sum_{n=1}^{&infin;}\frac{9}{10^n}$$ highlights the
                    infinity part of the problem. However, most readers will
                    read it as jargon and it won't help much by itself. An
                    explanation in simple words and a reminder that you are
                    dealing with infinities helps a lot more in comparison.

                    The calm and clear conversational tone in the answer is
                    soothing and it gives me comfort. On reading such answers,
                    you know that it comes from a person passionate about
                    mathematics, someone who cares about the reader reading and
                    the listener listening.

                    Mathematics is learnt and kept alive by discussions of this
                    kind. As Bill Thurston puts it:
                </p>

                            Mathematics only exists in a living community of
                            mathematicians that spread understanding and breath
                            life into ideas both old and new. The real
                            satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from
                            others and sharing with others.

                <p>
                    In most of the prescribed mathematics textbooks I had in
                    university, paragraphs explaining the math and the history
                    of how it came to be - were nowhere to be found. Dehumanized
                    sentences in the form of definitions and proofs which read
                    like computer code were plenty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To state all related definitions and theorems and proofs in
                    every single bit of math makes it verbose and impractical.
                    Terse notation is quite common in math papers.
                    Mathematicians seem to prefer concise proofs over clear
                    notation. The reader is expected to read the notation and
                    understand the math in context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, expecting a novice to just slog through symbol
                    manipulation and hoping that they will somehow end up with
                    reasonable math skills is naive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most people don't learn maths by sitting alone in a room and
                    manipulating symbols. They learn it from/with other people,
                    by discussion and asking questions. A few lines of
                    mathematics can elicit a few pages of explanation and the
                    reader might still have doubts about that piece of math.
                    This is why math written with symbols should be accompanied
                    by explanations in words to be effective. A balance between
                    dense notation (to save space) and clear explanation (to
                    make sense) is required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with the skill of working with abstract symbols, the
                    skill of explaining mathematics in simple terms, in words
                    that are easy to understand - this has to be practiced. This
                    allows you to connect and communicate easily, and this is
                    crucial in mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To everyone who wishes to learn more of mathematics, remind
                    yourself to take it in small bits and pieces.
