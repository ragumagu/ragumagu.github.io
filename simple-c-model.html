            <h1>
                A simple computer model for the C programming language
            </h1>

            <span id="toggle-color-theme"></span>

            <p>
                The C programming language is favoured by many engineers. Programs written in C can run on machines with bare minimum computing power and memory. The language itself is quite simple, and with some reading and practice, programmers can easily keep a mental
                model of the language in their mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, you will write simple programs, and with time, you will gain the ability to guess what a program might do, just by reading its source code. You will sometimes get weird behaviour from running certain programs and you will need to know how the
                underlying machine works, for the behaviour to make any sense. You will have to learn some history to truly understand the idioms and practices that have evolved over decades.
            </p>
            <p>

                You will realize the wisdom in certain practices, and you will recognize the mistake in certain traditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The C language does not provide utilities that you can get in higher level languages. For example, when working with arrays, you will often need to know how many items it contains. But with C, you don't even get a built-in function to get this length.
                One would think that a length function would be quite useful, but C leaves you on your own.
            </p>
            <p>

                Arrays in C are basically syntactic sugar: they are an abstraction to help with having to iterate over memory addresses. Arrays are virtually contiguous in memory and you can assume that arrays <em>decay</em> into pointers: with a pointer
                to the first element in the array, you can iterate over the array by dereferencing the pointer and incrementing it in a loop. However, arrays and pointers are not the same: you can't reassign an array like you can with a pointer variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are just starting out, all of these tiny details get in the way and you will still not understand why you just can't get the length of an array<label for="sn-array-len" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
                    id="sn-array-len" class="margin-toggle" />
                <span class="sidenote">Some solutions include dividing the <em>sizeof array</em> by <em>sizeof array[0]</em>, but that hack works only in global scope. If you want length of array, just get it from the declaration or where ever you malloc. If you want it in a function, pass it as a parameter. Even if  content length is dynamic, you will be using fixed-sized buffers to store such content anyway.</span>.
                Why don't people add such obviously useful features into the language?
            </p>

            <p>
                Languages are built to express ideas. If you have a lot of trouble finding the right words, you should try to put it across in a different way. See how it is done: you learn a lot of the language by observing how it is used. You will get used to idioms:
                phrases which are used to convey common/frequently occuring ideas. You will gradually develop a mental model for how the language works. You will improve your understanding of the language, and become profient in it. You will know how
                to express certain ideas efficiently, and you will know which ones to avoid.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will grow till you reach the limit of the language itself, at which point, you will know enough to add to it. Or you will move on to a better language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially though, you will need some help learning the basics of the language. In this post, I will describe a simple computer model from which basic features of C will follow.
            </p>

            <p>Consider a computer as a machine having 2 main components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compute</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Think of compute as a unit that can perform some operations.</p>
            <p>Think of storage as a bunch of cells: each cell can hold a value.</p>

            <h2>A primitive model</h2>
            <p>
                Compute is a unit that can perform some operations. Let's not get into the details of how it does it<label for="sn-how-compute-works" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-how-compute-works" class="margin-toggle"
                />
                <span class="sidenote">
                    Run some current through a bulb, it will give you some light. Lower the voltage, you get less light. We interpret lower voltage output as a zero and higher output voltage as one.
                    <br>
                    With power sources, transistors, resistors and a bunch of other electronic components, you can build circuits which can do some logic. You build a circuit, give it a zero and it will return one, give it a one and it will return zero and so on.
                    <br>
                    A sufficiently complex circuit can do what we can interpret as addition. You can even build a circuit which can keep results in its <em>memory</em>.
                    <br>
                    Now, suppose we have a <q>load</q> instruction. The letters <code>l, o, a, d</code> can be assigned numbers (with ASCII scheme, for example), and this number can then be converted into binary bits (zeros and ones). Somehow, we pass these bits
                    to our complex computer circuit, and it will <em>understand</em> that it has to take the incoming signal and put it into some destination.
                    <br>
                    I will stop adding more detail to this, because the margin is too small and the explanation too long.
            </span>. For all of our intents and purposes, the compute is an abstraction, and given inputs, it will process them and give outputs.
            </p>
            <p> The order in which inputs to compute are executed is called
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow" target="_blank">control flow.</a> By default, control flow is sequential: typically starts at first line, proceeding to the next till the end is reached.
                <p>
                    Storage is a bunch of cells, each cell has an address and can hold one value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's define some operations for our compute. Assume, that compute can take the address of a cell from the input, and get the value in that cell. Compute can also take a literal value from input instruction/code, and put it into a cell. Finally, compute
                    can take two addresses, and copy value from one source to destination. This is called the load operation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can define an add operation: take a cell address, and take a literal value from input and add the value to the value in the cell address. We can also define add to take two addresses, and add the value in the source address to the value in the destination
                    address.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, we include a <q>comment</q> feature: our input code can contain comments which are lines ignored by the computer. Comments make code easier to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can feed the computer instructions with input (code) like this:
                </p>


                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                <i>; <b>;</b> -&gt; lines starting with a colon are comments</i><br>
                <i>; <b>#num</b> -&gt; indicates a literal value.</i><br>
                <i>; <b>num</b> -&gt; numbers without '#' are addresses.</i><br>
                <i>; <b>load</b> the literal value 100 into cell with address 1</i><br>
                load 1, #100 <br>
                <i>; <b>add</b> the literal value 200 into cell with address 1</i><br>
                add 1, #200 <br>
                </code>
                </div>


                <p>
                    After running this code, we should end up with 300 in the cell with address 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might notice that this syntax is inspired by the 6502 assembly language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This computer model assumes the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Compute can somehow <em>read</em> the code and translate it into the respective operations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Load instruction can take literal values and put them into storage.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>This compute can add two numbers! Now, let's add some more capabilities.</p>
                <p>Suppose you want to add ten numbers, for example: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000.</p>
                <p>We can write the following program for this:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                    load 1, #100<br>
                    add 1, #200<br>
                    add 1, #300<br>
                    add 1, #400<br>
                    add 1, #500<br>
                    add 1, #600<br>
                    add 1, #700<br>
                    add 1, #800<br>
                    add 1, #900<br>
                    add 1, #1000<br>
                </code>
                </div>

                <p>Not bad, eh? Looks good enough.</p>
                <p>Let's add the multiply operation.</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                    mul 1, #10  <i>; multiples the value in cell 1 with literal 10 </i>
                </code>
                </div>

                <p>
                    We can use this computer to calculate weighted sums<label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-weighted-sum">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-weighted-sum" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Weighted sum is the sum of products of respective weights and quantities.</span>,
                    having weights in a bunch of cells and having some quantities in other cells.
                </p>
                <figure class="grayscale-diagram">
                    <p class="svg">
                        <img src="assets/drawing1_weighted_sum.svg" />
                    </p>
                </figure>

                <p>Weighted sums are quite useful. For example, if you had to calculate the total amount for a shopping list, you take the weights vector (price per one unit) and calculate the weighted sum with the quantities vector (number of units).

                Adding more features
            </h2>

            <p>If we introduce a few simple features, we can simplify the code so it becomes easier to read.
            </p>
            <h3>Subtraction (and signed numbers)</h3>


            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    sub 1, #10  <i>; subtract the literal value 10 from the value at address 1</i><br>

            <p>We introduce float numbers and the square root operation.</p>
            <h3>Floats and square roots</h3>

            <div class="code-block">

            <p>With this, we can write the following program:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    load 1, #3<br>

            <p>
                It might not be obvious at first, but this is Heron's formula and you should end up with the area of the triangle with sides 3-4-5 in cell 6. It would be incredibly tiring to do even the simplest math problems with this language. We need more expressiveness.
                Let's introduce variables and the minus operator.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Variables
            </h3>
            <p>A variable is simply a name for a storage cell. You can use refer to the cell by its name, and not worry about the address that actually holds the value.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    var 1, a <i>; create a variable named a, which refers cell 1.</i> 
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>The minus operator will get the negative value from a cell.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    load 1, -3 <i>; load the negative of value from cell 3, into cell 1</i><br>
                    load 1, -#3 <i>; load literal -3 into cell 1</i> 
                </code>
            </div>


            <p>We also introduce another construction: <b>ret</b> to return back, after jumping to a label. The code between the label and ret lines essentially becomes a block that can be run multiple times: forming the basis for functions. After executing
                the lines in the block, control returns and it is passed to the next line (after the caller goto line).
            </p>

            <p>Let's rewrite the program and see if it improves with these features:</p>


            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    var 1, a<br>
                    var 2, b<br>

                    load a, #3<br>
                    load b, #4<br>
                    load c, #5<br>
                    <br>

                    label $1<br>
                    load 10, 7<br>
                    add 10, 8<br>
                    add 10, 9<br>
                    ret<br>
                    <br>
                    load 7, a<br>
                    load 8, b<br>
                    load 9, c<br>
                    goto $1<br>
                    load 11, 10<br>
                    <br>
                    load 7, -a<br>
                    load 8, b<br>
                    load 9, c<br>
                    goto $1<br>
                    mul 11, 10<br>
                    <br>
                    load 7, a<br>
                    load 8, -b<br>
                    load 9, c<br>
                    goto $1<br>
                    mul 11, 10<br>
                    <br>
                    load 7, a<br>
                    load 8, b<br>
                    load 9, -c<br>
                    goto $1<br>
                    mul 11, 10<br>
                    <br>
                    sqrt 12, 11<br>
                    mul 12, #0.25<br>
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>
                Now, with some indentation in the code, and variable names, we can observe that the variables are getting cycled around, added and multiplied. But it does not look much simpler than the previous program.
            </p>

            <p>To improve this, we actually have to introduce a way to define parameters to the function block.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    var 1, a<br>
                    var 2, b<br>
                    var 3, c<br>

                    load a, #3<br>
                    load b, #4<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp; load 10, x<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; add 10, y<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; add 10, z<br>
                    ret<br>
                    <br>

                    goto $1 (a, b, c)<br>
                    load 11, 10<br>
                    goto $1 (-a, b, c)<br>
                    mul 11, 10<br>
                    goto $1 (a, -b, c)<br>
                    mul 11, 10<br>
                    goto $1 (a, b, -c)<br>

            </div>

            <p>

                With function block and parameter lists, we introduce the concept of scope and local variables. Variables x, y, z are only used within the function block =&gt; meaning they are limited in scope to the block.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also introduce the function keyword: which indicates that there is a block of lines which will continue till the ret word is found.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Starting with compute and storage, code and control flow, and basic instructions like load and add, we gradually expanded a primitive language to include the following concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>signed numbers and subtraction</li>
                <li>multiplication</li>
                <li>pointers</li>
                <li>control statements, like if else and goto</li>
                <li>float numbers</li>
                <li>square roots</li>
                <li>variables</li>
                <li>function blocks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can take this further and add features like structs and types, and make the language more expressive.
            </p>

            <p>
                The fact that we used pointers much before we even needed variables show how simple pointers can be, and how essential and expressive they are.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you can reason about why certain language features are built the way they are, you will find it easier to work with them. You will know where the language excels, and know what constructions best express your solution to certain problems. At the same
                time, you will also know what features to avoid, as they won't fit your use-case at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you can build simple/approximate models and explain the core features of a system with reasoning, then you will have the capacity to reason about its behaviour. 
            </p>

            <p>
                You can then scale this logic up. When debugging large programs, you won't be able to reason about the entire system at once. However, you can take the program apart line by line, and interpret what each line is doing, and see if it matches with what you expect it to be doing.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you encounter features in a language which don't seem obvious: try to find out
                why it exists and what problems it solves.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>About Heron's formula</em>: it is obvious that the language and compute model described till now is nowhere as expressive as writing:
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">

                <code>result = &frac14; &radic; ((a+b+c) * (-a+b+c) * (a-b+c) * (a+b-c))</code>
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to do that, you would need a compiler which will have lexers and parsers, which generate abstract syntax trees and intermediate code representations amongst other things, but that would not be a simple computer model anymore, would it? :)
