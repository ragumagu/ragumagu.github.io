    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        I am Shrinidhi Raghunandan, artist and engineer from Bengaluru.</p>
    <p>
        I play the mridangam and kanjira (Indian classical music - Carnatic percussion).
    </p>
    <p>
        I provide solutions in image analytics and data science, and I write software mostly with python and javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> site, where I plan to write about music, software: to share my musings and realizations as I come across them.
