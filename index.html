                I am Shrinidhi Raghunandan, artist and engineer from Bengaluru.</p>
            <p>
                I play the mridangam and kanjira (Indian classical music - Carnatic percussion).
            </p>
            <p>
                I provide solutions in image analytics and data science, and I write software mostly with python and javascript.

                This is my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> site, where I plan to write about music, software: to share my musings and realizations as I come across them.
