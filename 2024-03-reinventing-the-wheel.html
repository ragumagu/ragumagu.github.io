                <p>
                    I present two cases where I thought
                    <q>I have to make an app for that</q>, but ended up using
                    solutions that already existed. Then, I present one case
                    where I could not use existing solutions, so I had to make
                    my own.
                </p>

                <h2>Managing software processes</h2>
                <p>
                    I had to deploy a project with some analytics (built with
                    Python), a backend (built with Flask), and a frontend (built
                    with React.Js). I needed a way to keep them running, with
                    simple triggers to start, stop, and restart it as needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At first, I made many experiments with Python subprocesses
                    and PowerShell scripts and executables, writing a driver to
                    start and keep all the programs running. But that became a
                    hairy mess quite fast: how would you restart the driver if
                    it goes down? Its turtles all the way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One way to do this is by running the program as a service.
                    This was a Windows server, and Windows Services can be
                    written in Python using the PyWin32 extensions. However,
                    getting it to work, debugging it and maintaining it was
                    quite hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realized I could use a process manager. A process manager
                    like pm2 lets you specify all the programs and scripts to
                    run in a config file. You can also set up restart
                    strategies<label
                        class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
                        for="mn-windows"
                    ></label
                    ><input
                        type="checkbox"
                        id="mn-windows"
                        class="margin-toggle"
                    /><span class="sidenote">
                        Windows got in the way again: there is no init system
                        and running <code>pm2 startup </code> raises an error at
                        the time of writing this post. To have pm2 start on
                        reboot, you can add a PowerShell script to start up. If
                        pm2 crashes, you have to just restart it manually.
                    </span>

                    and cron jobs if needed.
                </p>

                <h2>Making vector images</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to digitally re-create some figures from a scanned
                    document, so I could view them in more detail and play
                    around. Some of the figures were simple bar and line plots,
                    and I could make them easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some were diagrams of complex machinery, and making them
                    isn't a straight-forward task. I had to get the scan as a
                    vector image.
                </p>
                <p>PNG to vector convertors didn't work well.</p>
                <p>
                    I tried extracting contours from the image with a Python
                    script, and then tried converting them into straight lines
                    and bezier curves. But the source image was noisy, and I
                    could not extract meaningful contours from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought I would have to build an app that let me trace and
                    save a vector image. Later, I realized I could just use
                    Inkscape to do this. It seems obvious now, but it did not
                    occur to me that I could do it this way, till I listed out
                    the desired features<label
                        class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
                        for="mn-js"
                    ></label
                    ><input
                        type="checkbox"
                        id="mn-js"
                        class="margin-toggle"
                    /><span class="sidenote">
                        I would have to capture mouse-x and y coordinates and
                        handle click and drag events. I would also need an
                        algorithm that would fit a bezier curve to pass through
                        the points I selected, and I needed a way to move the
                        nodes, to wiggle the curve, for fitting it better. I
                        could do this in JavaScript, and show the diagram in the
                        background with the HTML Canvas element. I also had to
                        figure out how to convert the coordinates into an SVG
                        and also learn how to save this. I ignored the need for
                        an undo stack, zoom and hundreds of other issues that I
                        would encounter when building this.
                    </span>
                    for the app I would build. Inkscape even lets you draw in
                    layers, so you can work on detailed parts individually.
                </p>

                <h2>Stepping through a video frame by frame</h2>
                <p>
                    I was working on a remote server, and I had to step through
                    a lot of video, frame by frame. I needed an app which was
                    fast enough to whiz through lots of footage and gave me
                    keyboard shortcuts to play/pause and goto next/previous
                    frames.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VLC supports going through a video frame by frame. And many
                    other solutions would do this out of the box. Surely I would
                    not have to write an app for this, right? <em>Right?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wrong. The server didn't have an app for that. I could not
                    install any apps on it, because of firewalls and other
                    restrictions. I could not download to my local machine
                    either, because the files were too big. :/
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up saving the frames to separate image files on
                    disk, and wrote a small app (with Tkinter and Pillow) with a
                    slider to scroll through.
                </p>

                    If you know the fundamentals involved in a problem, you will
                    know what is possible. You will know when to reach for an
                    existing solution; you will appreciate and criticise it, and
                    you will know when it is wrong. You will also know how to
                    build a solution when you can't reach for the existing one.
                    You might even come up with a better solution when building
                    it.

                    This resonates with what Casey Muratori said at the start of
                    his

                    project, literally in episode 1. When a viewer asked the
                    question:
                    <q>Why not use an engine? Why reinvent the wheel?</q>, he
                    replied:
                </p>
                <div>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            If you start with an engine, then it changes what
                            you're learning, from the fundamental truth of how
                            to implement a game, to someone else's version of
                            that. What you're really learning is that engine.
                            You haven't learned how to make games, you've
                            learned how to make games in that engine. Right? And
                            if that engine were to disappear, for example, you
                            would no longer know how to make a game at all. I'm
                            not exaggerating this, that's just the truth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It always bothers me when people say
                            <q>why reinvent the wheel</q>, because the wheel is
                            an amazing invention. It is almost perfect -- or
                            quite possibly perfect -- for what it does.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is something that so elegant and beautiful, that
                            if you were to ask why we would want to reinvent it,
                            I would say of course we do not want to reinvent it,
                            the wheel is amazing. It has worked for thousands of
                            years, and has been unchanged for thousands of
                            years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nothing we have developed in the past 30 years of
                            game-development, is a wheel. In the future, we will
                            have so much more powerful tools for game
                            development, that people will laugh at the things we
                            did to make games. If we want to get to a wheel, we
                            need people that will attempt to make the wheel.

                <p>Should you reinvent the wheel? It depends.</p>
                <p>
                    Should you know how to reinvent it? Yes. Wheels can always
                    be made rounder.
